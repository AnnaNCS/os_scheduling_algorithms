# Scheduling Algorithms 

Overview of the main scheduling algorithms and their comparisson. 

The main goal of this project was to:

* Overview, Implement, Compaire 
* How one algorithm is more efficient than another

## Algorithms 

Long-term scheduling

Short-term scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling algorithm

Preemptive scheduling algorithm

The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) algorithm, also known as FCFS (First-Come-First-Served)

The SJF (Shortest Job First) algorithm, also known as SJN (Shortest Job Next)

The SRT (Shortest Remaining Time) algorithm 

The LJT (Longest Job First) algorithm)

The LRFT (Longest Remaining Time First) algorithm

The round-robin (RR) algorithm 

Multilevel (ML) scheduling 

Under the multilevel feedback (MLF) algorithm

The rate monotonic (RM) algorithm

The earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm
