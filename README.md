# Scheduling Algorithms 

Overview of the main scheduling algorithms and their comparisson. 

The main goal of this project was to:

* Overview, Implement, Compaire 
* How one algorithm is more efficient than another

## Algorithms 

Long-term scheduling

Short-term scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling algorithm

Preemptive scheduling algorithm

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) algorithm, also known as FCFS (First-Come-First-Served)

SJF (Shortest Job First) algorithm, also known as SJN (Shortest Job Next)

SRT (Shortest Remaining Time) algorithm 

LJT (Longest Job First) algorithm)

LRFT (Longest Remaining Time First) algorithm

# Interactive Process Scheduling

Before going over the algorithms, it is crucial to 

Round-robin (RR) algorithm 

		○ priority determined solely by a process's position within the queue
		○ process at head of queue has highest priority and is allowed to run for Q time units
		○ when Q ends, process is moved to the tail of the queue and the next process now at the head of queue is allowed to run for Q time units

Multilevel (ML) scheduling 

Multilevel feedback (MLF) algorithm

Rate monotonic (RM) algorithm

Earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm
